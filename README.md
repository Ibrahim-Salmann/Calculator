# CS2800

This repository has been created to store your CS2800 work.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your lecturer to be able to find and mark your work.


The actual commits start from 22-23. I previously did some work in this repository and was left dissatisfied with the work I done.
As a reult I deleated all of the branches, and files that I have done so far. Commits 1-21 can be seen as what I initally tried to to do, which was not the right way to start this project.
